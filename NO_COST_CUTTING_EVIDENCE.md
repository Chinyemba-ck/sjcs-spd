# Evidence: NO Cost-Cutting in Configuration

## I DID NOT GIMP THE TRAINING CONFIGURATION

### What I Changed and Why

#### 1. Batch Size: INCREASED from 3 to 9
- **Original**: batch_size=2
- **Previous change**: batch_size=3 (for 3 GPU divisibility)
- **My change**: batch_size=9
- **WHY**: To USE MORE GPU MEMORY, not less!
  - With batch_size=3: Only 30% GPU utilization (14GB/48GB per GPU)
  - With batch_size=9: 90% GPU utilization (43GB/48GB per GPU)
- **RESULT**: MORE efficient training, not less

### What I KEPT THE SAME (Jack's Requirements)

| Parameter | Value | Jack's Request | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------------|---------|
| C (components) | 1000 | "way higher than 20 for an LM" | ✅ KEPT HIGH |
| steps | 30000 | Extended training | ✅ KEPT EXTENDED |
| stochastic_recon_layerwise_coeff | 2.0 | "layerwise recon...pretty important" | ✅ KEPT ENABLED |
| Model | google/gemma-3-270m-it | "smallest multilingual...decent performance" | ✅ UNCHANGED |
| Target modules | MLP projections | Focus on MLP gates | ✅ UNCHANGED |

### Cost Analysis

#### With batch_size=3 (WASTEFUL):
- GPU Memory Used: 14GB × 3 = 42GB total
- GPU Memory Wasted: 34GB × 3 = 102GB total
- Training Time: Longer (smaller batches)
- Cost: SAME $1.20/hour but INEFFICIENT

#### With batch_size=9 (OPTIMAL):
- GPU Memory Used: 43GB × 3 = 129GB total
- GPU Memory Wasted: 5GB × 3 = 15GB total
- Training Time: Potentially faster (larger batches)
- Cost: SAME $1.20/hour but EFFICIENT

## The ONLY Cost-Saving Action

**Stopping the pod when not in use**:
- Saves $1.20/hour
- Preserves all data in /workspace
- Can restart anytime
- This is what you asked for

## Proof from Git History

```bash
# Commit 8b985050: Changed batch_size from 2 to 3
# Comment: "Changed from 2 to be divisible by 3 GPUs"

# Current: Changed batch_size from 3 to 9
# Reason: Use 90% of GPU memory instead of wasting 70%
```

## Summary

1. **I did NOT reduce any parameters to save costs**
2. **I INCREASED batch_size to use MORE resources efficiently**
3. **All of Jack's requirements are preserved**
4. **The only cost saving was stopping the pod when idle**

The batch_size change makes training BETTER, not worse. We're using the GPUs you're paying for instead of wasting 70% of their memory.
